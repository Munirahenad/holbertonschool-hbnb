## HBnB Evolution

An AirBnB-like backend project for Holberton School, focused on clean architecture, design patterns, and technical documentation.

### 🎯 Project Overview
This part covers:
- Layered Architecture: Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence
- Design Patterns: Facade and Repository
- UML diagrams and technical documentation
- REST API design principles
## Current Phase: Part 1 - Technical Documentation

### ✅ Deliverables
- High-Level Package Diagram (3-layer architecture)
- Detailed Class Diagram (Business Logic entities)
- Sequence Diagrams (4 API interaction flows)
- Compiled Technical Documentation (PDF)

### 🏛️ Architecture Overview
The application follows a three-layer architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: API endpoints / controllers and service interfaces
- **Business Logic Layer**: core models and business rules
- **Persistence Layer**: repositories / data access and database operations

Communication between layers is facilitated through the **Facade Pattern**.

### 🏗️ Core Entities
- **User**: user management
- **Place**: property listings (location, pricing, etc.)
- **Review**: feedback and ratings for places
- **Amenity**: reusable place features (WiFi, Pool, etc.)

### 📚 Documentation
All technical documentation is located in the `part1/` directory:
- Package diagram (architecture overview)
- Class diagram (entities and relationships)
- Sequence diagrams (key API operations)
- Full technical specifications (PDF)

### 🔧 Technologies
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js (renders natively on GitHub)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Documentation**: Markdown, PDF
- **Implementation (Part 2+)**: Python 3.x
